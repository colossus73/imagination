				Imagination is a lightweight slide show creator developed in C with the GTK+2 toolkit and Cairo. Imagination is designed to be
				be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless options by default.
				It requires the ffmpeg encoder to produce the movie file and libsox to import the audio files. Yes you don't need any other third-party software!

				<para>
					This section allows you to choose a random transition or to
					pick one from the drop-down menu. You can set the transition
					speed choosing among Fast, Normal and Slow and the time in
					seconds that the slide must remain still. Finally you can
					see the total time length of the slideshow. Note: at least
					one slide must be selected for this section to work.
				</para>
				<para>
					NOTE: When slide has motion applied to it, slide duration
					field is disabled and cannot be modified, since duration of
					still part is now calculated as a sum of all stop points'
					durations and will be automatically updated.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="slide_motion">
				<title>Slide Motion</title>
				<para>
					This section allows you to apply the famous Ken Burns
					effects on a slide. Just begin by zooming in/out and
					dragging image around with left mouse button to center a
					detail on the picture. Now click Add button and Imagination
					will add a new stop point with currently selected zoom level
					and image position. You can add as many points as you want.
				</para>
				<para>
					You can see how each stop point looks like by selecting it
					using left and right arrows or by directly entering point
					number in proper field. Imagination will update it's preview
					area to show you your selected stop point.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you commit a mistake or want to change some point, simply
					select problematic point and re-adjust your slide.
					Imagination will automatically update the values for you.
				</para>
				<para>
					The Remove button deletes a stop point. Simply select
					point that should be removed and click Remove button.
				</para>
				<para>
					Click the Preview button on the toolbar or choose
					<menuchoice><guimenu>Slideshow</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preview</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
					to have a preview of the effect.
				</para>
				<para>
					NOTE: This section is available only when exactly one slide
					is selected.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="slide_text">
				<title>Slide Text</title>
				<para>
					Imagination can add some text to your slides. Just start
					typing in proper field and text will show up in image
					area.
				</para>
				<para>
					You can modify text's font size, variant and family using
					font button below the text field. Color is controlled by two
					color selector buttons (font color and text outline color)
                    right of the font button (font color can be partially transparent too).
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="slide_text_position">
				<title>Slide Text Position</title>
				<para>
					Starting from 3.4 version text can be positioned
					anywhere on the slide. The position dropdown menu
					was removed. The slide subtitle can be rotated too.
				</para>
				<para>
					Text entrance can also be animated. Simply select animation
					from combo box, set the duration of the effect and enjoy.
				</para>
				<para>
					NOTE: If duration of the text animation function exceedes
					duration of the slide, slide duration is synchronized with
					it. This is done on two ways: if slide has no motion
					applied, still part of the slide is simply expanded; if
					slide has motion applied, last stop point is expanded to
					fit.
				</para>
				<para>
					How to have text stand still for a period of time? Just make
					sure that slide duration is longer than text animation
					duration. For example, if you want to have 6 seconds of text
					movement and 4 seconds of still text, you should set text
					animation duration to 6 seconds and slide duration to 10
					seconds (6 seconds of text animation + 4 seconds of still
					time).
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="audio_tab">
				<title>Audio Tab</title>
				<para>
					By clicking on the "Audio" tab the background music list is
					displayed. Here you can see the length of each of the
					imported audio files along with the total time length of all
					the compatible audio files (see below for more information
					about audio file compatibility). Play button allows you to
					preview selected audio file. The arrow buttons allow you to
					reorder the audio files and the last one deletes the selected audio files.
				</para>
				<para>
					Not all files can be concatenated. Imagination will inform
					you about any incompatibilities when you import your audio
					files. More detailed information can be obtained from audio
					files list. Red colored files have incompatible sample
					rate, while blue colored ones have incompatible number of channels and
					those orange colored have incompatible sample rate and number of
					channels. If you hover the mouse over an audio file entry, you'll also
					get some information about it. At export time, Imagination
					will again inform you about any incompatible files in music
					list and ask you if's OK to remove them from the slideshow.
				</para>
				<para>
					Current state of audio support in Imagination is quite
					limited. All compatible audio files listed are concatenated
					together (no cross fading) and truncated to fit slideshow
					total length (truncation is gradual with 5 second fade-out).
					If you wish to have nicer audio in slideshows, you should
					probably create your slideshow in three steps: 1. Create
					slideshow without audio (this will give you the total
					duration); 2. Prepare audio file that exactly fits the
					duration; 3. Add prepared audio to slideshow and export.
					Please note that Imagination WILL NOT use incompatible audio
					files to calculate the total Music Duration length.

			<para>Located in the bottom part of Imagination's window the thumbnail area displays the imported slides. Left clicking on one of it displays the slide in the image area along with the slide settings in the working area. Drag and drop is supported so you can import your favorite pictures by dragging them here. Rubber banding is supported too so you can select a group of slides by left clicking on some white space and then by moving the mouse. You can also reorder the slides by holding down left mouse button and by moving them around.</para>

		<sect2 id="status_bar">
			<title>Status Bar</title>
			<para>As the name suggests this area, located under the thumbnails one, displays info about the number of transitions loaded at startup, the number of imported slides, and some info on the slide itself when only one slide is selected (otherwise the total number of selected slides is displayed).</para>
