Imagination is a lightweight DVD slide show maker developed with GTK+2.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
===================

If you intend to install Imagination (as opposed to just running make and then
lauching src/imagination), you must compile with CFLAGS="-DPLUGINS_INSTALLED=1".
If you fail to do so Imagination won't be able to load the transitions and the
transition's images.
