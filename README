Imagination is a lightweight and easy to use slide show maker for Linux and FreeBSD written in C language and built with the GTK+3 toolkit in development since 2009. It uses cairo 2D library to achieve the transactions. I need help to make it modern and update it to current technologies such as a resizable and rotating textbox to insert text. Also in view of the 4.0 big release I want to give imagination a modern timeline. Would you help with it? You can find it here: https://github.com/colossus73/gtk_timeline

In 2024 the development started again. I was finally able to get rid of spawning the ffmpeg executable in the background and use libav directly to encode the video. Sound is not yet encoded.
If you would like to know more please feel free to drop me a message: colossus73@gmail.com

Have a positive day!
Giuseppe
